Rezerwacja_boisk is a simple application for doing reservations of sports grounds.
I have created this project in order to enhance my programming skills. The application is based on a Django framework.

How to run rezerwacja_boisk on your own server:
 - install virtualenv and django
 - clone repository
 - make migrations and migrate
 - create superuser account
 - in admin panel (localhost:8000/admin) add manually some places and sports grounds attached to them
 - set dates in do_reservations.py file (default are 2016/9/1 and 2016/9/5)
 - run do_reservations.py
 - have fun :D
